A canopy for a wheelchair

### What it is
 This is a simple canopy for a wheelchair or 4 wheeled mobility scooter. I have traveled using public transportation often, but I have never seen this. It would be easy to create using CAD to model the mounting brackets and connections.

- 3D printed brakets and conections
    + There will need to be many different types of mounting brackets for the differing types of wheelchairs and scooters. These brackets should be included in the MIT license to prevent overcharging for a necessary part.  
    + It will likely be necessary to produce this in a few sizes to accomodate differing widths and lengths of wheelchairs and scooters

### Materials and tools 
__Materials:__
- Waterproof nylon fabric for the cover
- fiberglass rods used for tentpoles can add structure for the canopy
- ABS 3D printed brackets and connectors
- Various nuts and bolts

__Tools:__
- CAD software for the brackets and connectors 
    + could be milled out of plastic stock 
- 3D printer
- Sewing machine
- Hand tools

### Opportunity
- This would make a great project for a college entrance portfolio
- Good for a micro startup. Even if you bought all the tooling someone could produce this for around 1K USD.
- It would be a good project for a maker competition or science fair

### Options and Upgrades
- Brackets at the top rear of the canopy for attatching penant flags because everyone needs a staff car.
- Brakets at the leading edge of the canopy for mounitng bluetooth speakers
- Brakets at the leading edge of the canopy for mounitng small driving lights
- Add flexible thin film solar panels to the roof of the canopy to charge a USB battery pack
    + A basic solar charge controller to manage the charging of the USB battery pack and prevent it from draining the battery at night
    + Consideration the operation in differing weather conditions. Rain/snow etc.
- Fringe for the canopy ... this thing should have style :)

## Why this project
I have seen people out in the sun and rain with no protection. Umbrellas are too awkward considering that the user has to dive the wheelchair and hold the umbrella. I think this just needs to be.

## Another small mobility idea
A hitch added to the rear of a mobility scooter used to tow a trailer. It would help to solve the need of how to get your groceries home. The trailer could be the folding kind, so it could be stowed when not in use.
